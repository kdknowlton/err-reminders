err-reminders
=============

ErrBot plugin to get and set scheduled reminders over chat.  
You NEED to change the locale, if you are not from germany.  

Basic Usage:  
!remind me \<when\> -> \<what\>  

Example:
!remind me tomorrow 11:00 -> Cook coffee.  
!remind me next Friday -> Party hard.

Example Output:  
Hello \<nick\>, here is your reminder: \<text\>

You can your own locale that stuff like "tommorow" "next week" etc work in your language.
