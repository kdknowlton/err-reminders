err-reminders
=============

This was forked to solve compatability issues with the latest version of errbot.

ErrBot plugin to get and set scheduled reminders over chat.  
You NEED to change the locale, if you are not from germany.  

Basic Usage:  
!remind me \<when\> -> \<what\>  

Example:
!remind me tomorrow 11:00 -> Cook coffee.  
!remind me next Friday -> Party hard.

Example Output:  
Hello \<nick\>, here is your reminder: \<text\>

You can your own locale that stuff like "tommorow" "next week" etc work in your language.
